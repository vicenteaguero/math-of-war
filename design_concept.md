# Book Design Concept

The book will be written in Spanish and English.

The book will be short, around 150-250 pages.

The book will be written in a way that everyone can understand the math concepts and the historical examples.

## Cover Design

**Concept**: The cover needs to be amazing. People will judge the book by the cover. Probably, the top of the cover will have the title of the book in a
very big font. I still don't know if will have a subtitle. My name could go
in the bottom of the cover not very big as I am not a famous author. The most
important part will be the image. Probably, the background will be similar
to a battlefield. But, the interesting part will be a $\pi$ symbol in the AT-AT of Star Wars style. Will be made of maybe bullets or with a mechanical style. The idea is to show that the book is about math and war. Including a
tank could be a good idea too. The cover will be in color. I will love to
have a hardcover version of the book. In the spine, the title of the book
in a very big and clear font. The spine is very important because the book
as not being from a famous author will be in a shelf with other books. The
spine is the only part that will be visible. The back cover will have a
short description of the book with some images of mathematical war soldiers.
